<h2><a name = "Title1"> 1. Project Overview </a></h2>

The [GuideXP](https://guidexp.wordpress.com) is a local startup in Canberra with the vision of creating immersive visitor experiences for galleries, museums and more. GuideXP is a unique, cloud-based approach to audio guides, which allows for access to content from multiple attractions in one place and aims to minimise effort required in uploading and updating content.
In 2019, GuideXP is partnering with the ANU TechLauncher program to kick start our development. The program will enable us to create a first stage of our product roadmap while engaging with students and providing them real world experience.
We are currently seeking a partner institution to create or share visitor experience content and provide us with feedback as we develop the minimum viable product and test our value propositions. The partner institution will benefit from free use of the service for the duration of 2019.
The GuideXP Team consists of four members plus the our ANU TechLauncher team (TBC), with a myriad of experience in tech delivery projects, startups, and visitor experience. We are motivated and excited by the prospect of working with a renowned institution such as the Australian Parliament House.
